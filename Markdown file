#**What I've learned**
##**I have learned** some ways to *style* text as well as some more ***terms*** used commonly in github.
### I still find the difference between a branch and fork a little confusing, it seems like they aren't so different as it seems like they are both used to contribute to a repository. Is it just that a fork is further separated from the main repository?
